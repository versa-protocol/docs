# Sending a Receipt

The sender is a protocol client typically operated by a merchant. The sender's responsibilities include:

1. Register the transaction.
2. Encrypt the receipt.
3. Send the encrypted receipt.

## Register the transaction

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://registry.versa.org/register' \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "receipt_hash": 175932758392347,
    "protocol_version": "0.1.0",
    "email_domain": "acme.com"
  }'
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "key": [...],
  "transaction_id": "txn_458a58b2dd7a4fe3a9ad3165a511ac2a",
  "receivers": [
    { "address": "https://bank.com/receipt" },
    { "address": "https://expenseapp.com/receipt" }
  ]
}
```

## Encrypt the receipt

Receipts are encrypted with the AES 256 encryption algorithm, using the registry-provided key and a unique nonce generated for each receiver.

## Send the encrypted receipt

The nonce and encrypted data are sent to each receiver address, at which point they have the opportunity to check out the key from the registry, and decrypt the envelope.

```json
{
  "receipt_hash": 175932758392347,
  "nonce": [...],
  "encrypted": [...]
}
```

## Updating an Existing Receipt

Updating a receipt, such as to include a tip, refund, or other adjustment, is no different from registering a new receipt.
The only difference is that the original transaction_id returned by the registry must be included in the updated registration request.

E.g. 

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://registry.versa.org/register' \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "receipt_hash": 923232454472219,
    "transaction_id": "txn_458a58b2dd7a4fe3a9ad3165a511ac2a",
    "protocol_version": "0.1.0",
    "email_domain": "acme.com"
  }'
```

This will associate the new receipt record with the original receipt's transaction record.
The transaction_id is always returned to each receiver when they check out their keys, so that they can update the receipts on their end and trigger events to their customers.
