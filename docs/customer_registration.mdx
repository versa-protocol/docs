# Customer Registration

Versa routes receipts by matching against registered customers. Every time a sender (e.g. an airline, an E-commerce merchant) makes a sale, they check to see if one or more clients (e.g. an expense management app) are authorized to pull down receipts for that customer. For example: if Supplier A completes a sale to 'jshmoe@acme.com', and if Expense Management App B has registered as an authorized receiver of 'acme.com' receipts, then Versa will direct Supplier A to forward the encrypted receipt to Expense Management App B.

## How It Works

Customers explicitly grant permission to receivers to collect receipts on their behalf.

Registering and de-registering handles is typically performed via API. The Versa web app also includes a user interface to perform this action.

To register a handle via API:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://registry.versa.org/customer' \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "handle_type": "customer_email_domain",
    "handle": "acme.com"
  }'
```

| Field             | Type              | Description                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `handle_type`     | `enum`            | One of `customer_email_domain` (e.g. acme.com) or `customer_email` (e.g. jshmoe@acme.com). |
| `handle`          | `string`          | The handle value.                                                                          |
| `receiver_org_id` | `nullable string` | The org id of the intended receiver. Required for any sender registration.                 |

> [!NOTE]
> Versa also supports `payment_account_reference` (PAR), `merchant_group_code`, and `merchant_user_code` handles, but to enable these forms of matching, you’ll need to be opted in by the Versa support team.

You’re responsible for collecting the necessary permission when registering customers. For `customer_email` registrations, the email addresses you add will also be subject to a verification step. When you initiate an email address registration, that registration will be put into a pending state. Versa sends a verification email to the address; you will start to receive matching receipts only after the recipient clicks the verification link contained in that email.

When you lose a customer, you will de-register them. To remove a registered profile:

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://registry.versa.org/customer' \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "handle_type": "customer_email_domain",
    "handle": "acme.com"
  }'
```

Typically, you’ll do a batch registration when you initially onboard to Versa, and from that point forward, you’ll manage your list of authorized customers synchronously, registering and de-registering handles as you add and remove customers.

In 'test' mode, 'production' receipts will not be sent. Your client will need to be set to 'production' mode to send or receive production receipts. Contact Versa Support for details.

## Receiver vs. Sender Customer Registration

Both receivers and senders can register customers, however these two types of registration have different scopes.

Receivers register customers to receive receipts from _any_ sender. For example, when an expense management app gets permission from a customer to collect receipts on their behalf, they will receive receipts from all participating sender merchants.

Senders, on the other hand, can only register customers to receive the receipts from their direct sales. E.g. a travel manager admin who is logged in to the company settings screen on the 'Nimbus Airlines' website could opt to push their Nimbus Airlines receipts to their expense management app, but they would not be able to turn on universal receipt sync from within the Nimbus Airlines website.

Technically speaking, these receiver vs. sender registration scopes are configured via the `receiver_org_id` parameter on the /customer endpoint. Receiver clients do not need to specifiy a `receiver_org_id` — they can either skip the paramter, or set the value to their own `client_id` (anything else will error). Sender clients attempting to register customers, on the other hand, must include a `receiver_org_id`, and that `receiver_org_id` must reference an active receiver client. If a sender client excludes the `receiver_org_id` parameter, the registration attempt will error.

Sender and receiver registrations are not mutually exclusive. For instance: if Sender A registers a customer for Receiver B, and Receiver B also registers that same customer, Versa will match against both registrations, and return a single reference to Receiver B.

## Sender Registration, "Merchant Group Codes", and "Merchant User Codes"

In addition to the standard domain and email -based forms of customer registration, senders can also register customers using a "merchant group code" (MGC) or a "merchant user code" (MUC).

A merchant group code is a unique identifer assigned to a corporate program. For example, a rental car company might have a 'corporate discount code' for Acme Co.

A merchant user code is a unique identifer assigned to an individual user. For example, an airline might have a loyalty program id for each of their frequent flyers.

'MGC' and 'MUC' handles give merchants the flexibility to register customers according to these core identifiers in their system, alongside more universal identifiers like domain and email.

Note: usage of 'MGC' and 'MUC' customer registration is currently invite-only. Contact Versa Support if you’d like to learn more about this feature.

### Listing receivers

If you are using sender registration, you can query our network of registered receivers using the [Receiver Query API](/receivers).
