# Sender Configuration

Receipt senders are typically merchants or merchant service providers such as booking, billing, or payment platforms. To send receipts via the Versa network, you’ll first need to [create an account](https://app.versa.org) on Versa.

Once you’re logged in to your account, you’re able to register your sending client. Go to the 'Credentials' tab, issue a new sender key, and store your credentials somewhere safe.
