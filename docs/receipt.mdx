# Receipt Object

Itemized receipts are the core data model of Versa. Receipts contain both the "header" information — the merchant, total amount, and date of the transaction — as well as the line-item details. For example, a receipt from a coffee shop would include the line items '2 x drip coffees,' '1 x donut,' and so on.

Going a layer deeper, receipts are composed of six distinct sections:

1. **Header Info**: E.g. merchant name, merchant logo, transaction date.
2. **Type Block**: Type-specific objects describing the purchased goods and service. E.g. check-in and check-out information for a hotel stay, origin and destination information for a ticketed flight. Note: this section is only present for special receipt types, and is frquently null. It also can include more than one type-specific object.
3. **Line Items**: The description, quantity, unit cost, and total for line item.
4. **Roll-up Block**: The subtotal, taxes, fees, tip, and grand total of the receipt.
5. **Actions**: Merchant-defined links, pivoting off the purchase. For example: 'Contact Support,' 'Buy Again,' 'manage subscription.'
6. **Payment Details**: Payment status and metadata associated with the receipt.

Below we describe each of these six sections.
