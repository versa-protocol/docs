# Receipt Object

Itemized receipts are the core data model of Versa. Receipts contain both the "header" information — the merchant name, merchant logo, total purchase amount, purchase date, etc. — as well as line item details — the quanitity, description, and cost of each item purchased.

Receipts are composed of six distinct sections:

1. **Header Info**: The top-level fields, e.g. merchant name, merchant logo, purchase date.
2. **Type Block**: Type-specific objects describing the purchased goods and service. E.g. check-in and check-out information for a hotel stay, origin and destination information for a ticketed flight. Note: this section is only present for special receipt types, and is frquently null. It also can include more than one type-specific object.
3. **Line Items**: The description, quantity, unit cost, and total for each line item.
4. **Roll-up Block**: The subtotal, taxes, fees, tip, combined discounts, and grand total of the receipt.
5. **Actions**: Merchant-defined links, pivoting off the purchase. For example: 'Contact Support,' 'Buy Again,' 'Manage Subscription.'
6. **Payment Details**: Payment status and metadata associated with the receipt.

Below we describe each of these six sections.

## Header Info

## Type Blocks

Type blocks are a series of templates specific to different categories of goods and services.

Versa covers the following type blocks: `shipment`, `flight`, `route`, `location`, `subscription`, `car_rental`, `lodging`.

A receipt may have zero, one, or multipe type blocks. For instance, a delivery from Home Depot would have a `shipment` type block and a `location` type block.

We will specificy the schema for each type block in a future update.

## Line Items

Line items describe the goods and services that make up the purchase. The sum of the line item totals equal the `subtotal` value in the receipt header.

`line_items` is an array of `line_item` objects:

```jsx
{
  ...
  "line_items" : [
    {
      quantity: 10,
      description:
        "Blue Cheese Crumbles",
      unit_cost: 178,
      tax: 100,
      total: 1780,
      metadata: [{ key: "SKU", value: "524959" }],
      product_image: "",
      group: "Dairy"
    },
    {
      quantity: 3,
      description:
        "Vinegar Sherry Wine Spain",
      unit_cost: 267,
      tax: 100,
      total: 801,
      metadata: [{ key: "SKU", value: "941157" }],

## Roll-up Block

The roll-up block includes taxes, fees, tip, and discounts, culminating in the grand total. The specific schema will be described in a future update.

## Actions

Provide useful next actions in the Actions section. An action is typically a deep URL, linking to a useful part of ther merchant's website. Currently, you are limited to three total actions or fewer.

```JSX
