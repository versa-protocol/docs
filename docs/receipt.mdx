# Receipt Object

Itemized receipts are the core data model of Versa. They include both “header” information — the merchant name, merchant logo, total purchase amount, purchase date, etc. — as well as “line item” details — the quanitity, description, and cost of each item purchased.

Versa receipts are composed of six sections:

1. **Header**: Top-level fields, e.g. merchant name, merchant logo, purchase date.
2. **Type Block**: Type-specific objects describing the purchased goods and service. E.g. check-in and check-out information for a hotel stay, origin and destination information for a ticketed flight. Note: this section is only present for special receipt types, and is otherwise absent.
3. **Line Items**: Description, quantity, unit cost, and total for each line item.
4. **Roll-up**: Subtotal, taxes, fees, tip, discounts, and grand total of the receipt.
5. **Actions**: Merchant-defined links, pivoting off the purchase. For example: 'Contact Support,' 'Buy Again,' 'Manage Subscription.'
6. **Payment**: Payment status and metadata associated with the receipt.

Below we cover each of these six sections in detail.

## 1. Header Info

## 2. Type Blocks

The Type Blocks section consist of a series of templates specific to different categories of goods and services.

Versa covers the following type blocks: `shipment`, `flight`, `route`, `location`, `subscription`, `car_rental`, `lodging`.

A receipt may have zero, one, or multipe type blocks. For instance, a delivery from Home Depot would have a `shipment` type block and a `location` type block.

We will specificy the schema for each type block in a future update.

## Line Items

Line items describe the goods and services that make up the purchase. The sum of the line item totals equal the `subtotal` value in the receipt header.

`line_items` is an array of `line_item` objects:

```jsx
{
  ...
  "line_items" : [
    {
      quantity: 10,
      description:
        "Blue Cheese Crumbles",
      unit_cost: 178,
      tax: 100,
      total: 1780,
      metadata: [{ key: "SKU", value: "524959" }],
      product_image: "",
      group: "Dairy"
    },
    {
      quantity: 3,
      description:
        "Vinegar Sherry Wine Spain",
      unit_cost: 267,
      tax: 100,
      total: 801,
      metadata: [{ key: "SKU", value: "941157" }],

## Roll-up Block

The roll-up block includes taxes, fees, tip, and discounts, culminating in the grand total. The specific schema will be described in a future update.

## Actions

Provide useful next actions in the Actions section. An action is typically a deep URL, linking to a useful part of ther merchant’s website. Currently, you are limited to three total actions or fewer.

```JSX

    { description: "Emergency Roadside Assistance", url: "/" },
    { description: "Rebook", url: "/", icon: "rebuy" },
  ],
  ...

## Payment Details

The payment details will be described in a future update.



## Definitions

### Currencies

All API requests expect amounts to be provided in a currency's smallest unit. For example, to charge 10 USD, provide an amount value of 1000 (that is, 1000 cents).

For zero-decimal currencies, still provide amounts as an integer but without multiplying by 100. For example, to charge ¥500, provide an amount value of 500.
