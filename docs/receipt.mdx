# Receipt Object

Itemized receipts are the core data model of Versa. They include both “header” information — the merchant name, merchant logo, total purchase amount, purchase date, etc. — as well as “line item” details — the quanitity, description, and cost of each item purchased.

Versa receipts are composed of six sections:

1. **Header**: Top-level fields, e.g. merchant name, merchant logo, purchase date.
2. **Type Block**: Type-specific objects describing the purchased goods and service. E.g. check-in and check-out information for a hotel stay, route and ticket information for a flight. Note: this section is only present for special receipt types, and is otherwise absent.
3. **Line Items**: Description, quantity, unit cost, and total for each line item.
4. **Roll-up**: Subtotal, taxes, fees, tip, discounts, and grand total of the receipt.
5. **Actions**: Merchant-defined links, pivoting off the purchase. For example: ‘Contact Support,’ ‘Buy Again,’ ‘Manage Subscription.’
6. **Payment**: Payment status and metadata associated with the receipt.

Below we cover each of these six sections in detail.

## Header

Here’s an example receipt header:

### Third Party Object

The third party object is used when the merchant is a platform. For example, if a coffee shop uses Square to process sales, the merchant would be Square and the third party would be the coffee shop. The `make_primary` flag specifies whether the merchant or third party should get top billing on the receipt.

| Field                  | Type      | Description                                                                                    |

| `merchant`             | `string`  | A [merchant](#merchant-object) object representing the third party.                            |

## Type Block

The Type Blocks section consists of a series of templates specific to different receipt types.

Versa covers the following types: `shipment`, `flight`, `route`, `location`, `subscription`, `car_rental`, `lodging`.

A receipt may have zero, one, or multipe type blocks. For instance, a delivery from Home Depot would have a `shipment` type block and a `location` type block.

We will specificy the schema for each type block in a future update.

## Line Items

Line items describe the goods and services that make up the purchase. The sum of the line item totals equal the `subtotal` value in the receipt header.

`line_items` is an array of `line_item` objects:

```json
{
  ...
  "line_items": [
    {
      "quantity": 10,
      "description": "Blue Cheese Crumbles",
      "unit_cost": 178,
      "tax": 100,
      "total": 1780,
      "metadata": [{ "key": "SKU", "value": "524959" }],
      "product_image": "",

### Line Item Metadata

Line item metadata consists of key/value pairs. This can be used to track things like SKU, Size, Color, UNSPSC Code, etc.

## Roll-up

The Roll-up block includes taxes, fees, tip, and discounts, culminating in the grand total. The specific schema will be described in a future update.

## Actions

Provide useful next actions in the Actions section. An action is typically a deep link to a useful part of ther merchant’s website. Three actions maximum.

## Payment

## Definitions & Formatting

### Currency Values

All API requests expect amounts to be provided in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, to represent 10 USD, provide an amount value of 1000 (that is, 1000 cents). For zero-decimal currencies, still provide amounts as an integer but without multiplying by 100. For example, to represent ¥500, provide an amount value of 500.

### Images

Images must be hosted at public URLs. The images are likely to be indexed by the receiver. For best results, no image dimension should be less than 400px, or greater than 2,000px.
