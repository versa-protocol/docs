# Assets

**_WIP_**

Efficiently store and deliver images and PDFs, for attachment to Versa receipts.

## Post an asset (senders)

Supported asset types include:

- PDF
- PNG
- JPEG
- WEBP

Assets have a 100 megabyte (MB) size limit.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://registry.versa.org/asset' \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET' \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your/file"
```

Success response:

```
{
  "asset_id": "asset_5ed073abbf3a4b49a8c03191f87d8ffe"
}
```

## Fetch an asset (receiver)

Go to 'www.url.com/asset_5ed073abbf3a4b49a8c03191f87d8ffe' to fetch the asset.

We encourage receivers to store copies of assets themselves. The hosted images should be treated as a cache.
