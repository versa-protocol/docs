# Assets

**_WIP_**

Efficiently store and deliver images and PDFs, for attachment to Versa receipts.

## Upload an asset (as a sender)

Supported asset types include:

- PDF
- PNG
- JPEG
- WEBP

Assets have a 50 megabyte (MB) size limit.

```bash
  curl -F "file=@/path/to/your/invoice.pdf;filename=invoice.pdf" \
    --header 'Authorization: Basic CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET' \
    https://registry.versa.org/asset
```

Success response:

```
{
  "asset_id": "asset_5ed073abbf3a4b49a8c03191f87d8ffe"
}
```

## Including assets in a receipt (as a sender)

Any asset in the [Receipt schema](/receipt) can be populated with the "asset_id" of the file you uploaded, e.g.

```json
{
  "receipt_asset_id": "asset_5ed073abbf3a4b49a8c03191f87d8ffe"
}
```

## Fetch an asset (as a receiver)

Go to `https://registry.versa.org/asset/ASSET_ID` to fetch the asset.

Any "asset_id" field in the schema corresponds to a file that can be retrieved in this way.

We encourage receivers to store copies of assets themselves. The hosted images should be treated as a cache. We regularly purge old assets.
