# Webhooks

Webhooks are how receiver clients consume Versa events.

## Supported Events

| Event                             | Description                                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `receipt`                         | The original encrypted payload. Existing senders use this event at the protocol level.  |
| `receipt.decrypted`               | The event received by custodial clients at their remote endpoint.                       |
| `itinerary`                       | The encrypted payload for an itinerary event, which excludes payment data.              |
| `itinerary.decrypted`             | As above, the custodial event for itineraries.                                          |
| `customer.registered_by_sender`   | An event triggered to the receiver client upon sender registration.                     |
| `customer.deregistered_by_sender` | An event triggered to the receiver client upon sender deregistration.                   |

## Using Webhooks

On the Versa network, receipt data is sent directly from verified merchants to receivers.
That means that the `receipt` event is posted to receivers by sending clients, not by the Versa registry.
All receivers use webhooks to handle encrypted data sent over the protocol,
and custodial clients use separate webhooks to get deliveries from Versa servers.

## Custodial Webhooks

Custodial clients subscribe to a `receipt.decrypted` event.
The custodial service receives and decrypts data on your behalf,
and then posts a separate webhook event to your remote endpoint, in the following format:

```json
{
  "event": "receipt.decrypted",
  "event_id": "evt_6abf1062dc2f4844a81b645b9a5dbf41",
  "event_at": 1739315358,
  "delivery_id": "whd_809aba728d6940de8e294af8b3ad272c",
  "delivery_at": 1739315358,
  "data": {
    "receipt": { ... },
    "checkout": {
      "sender": {
        "logo": "https://imagedelivery.net/image_url.png",
        "name": "Supplier Co.",
        "org_id": "org_b6d073a9bf3a4c49a8c03191f87d8ee2",
        "website": "supplier.com",
        "brand_color": "#f0C14B"
      },
      "handles": {
        "customer_email": "john.smith@example.com", 
        "customer_email_domain": "example.com"
      },
      "receipt_id": "rct_14a9817fea7d41bf941c16b8750cc845",
      "registered_at": 1739315357,
      "schema_version": "1.11.0",
      "transaction_id": "txn_6b408ba7406b4754b7b7d287e0ca9fdf",
      "transaction_event_index": 0
    }
  }
}
```

## API Reference

You can create, list, update, and delete your webhooks, and you can rotate your webhook secrets at any time
(remember to then update your destination endpoint with the new secret).

All webhook endpoints require Basic Authentication with your client credentials.

* POST `/webhook` - Create a new webhook
* GET `/webhook` - List all webhooks for your client
* PUT `/webhook/:id` - Update the `endpoint_url` or `events` for a specific webhook
* PUT `/webhook/:id/rotate` - Rotate the `secret` for a specific webhook
* DELETE `/webhook/:id` - Delete a specific webhook
