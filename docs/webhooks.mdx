# Webhooks

Webhooks are a more flexible way to consume Versa events.
Migrating to Webhooks is not necessary.
You can use Webhooks alongside your existing custodial implementation, or in place of itâ€”or not at all.

## Supported events

| Event                             | Description                                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `receipt`                         | The original encrypted payload. Existing senders use this event at the protocol level.  |
| `receipt.decrypted`               | The event used by Custodial receivers migrating to Webhooks.                            |
| `customer.registered_by_sender`   | An event triggered to the receiver client upon sender registration.                     |
| `customer.deregistered_by_sender` | An event triggered to the receiver client upon sender deregistration.                   |

## Using Webhooks

On the Versa network, receipt data is sent directly from verified merchants to receivers.
That means that the `receipt` event is posted to receivers by sending clients, not by the Versa registry.
If you are a self-hosted receiver, you are already using Webhooks behind the scenes,
and you can take advantage of the new `customer` webhooks by subscribing your existing webhook to the new events.

If you are a custodial receiver, you can migrate to Webhooks with a few simple API calls, using your client credentials.

## Migrating to Webhooks (Custodial)

In the default custodial configuration, decrypted receipt data is sent to your "receiver address" in the following structure:

```json
{
  "receipt_id": "rct_5ed073abbf3a4b49a8c03191f87d8ffe",
  "transaction_id": "txn_5ed073abbf3a4b49a8c03191f87d8ffe",
  "transaction_event_index": 0,
  "registered_at": 1739221813,
  "handles": {
    "customer_email": "jshmoe@acme.com"
  },
  "sender": {
    "org_id": "org_b6d073a9bf3a4c49a8c03191f87d8ee2",
    "name": "Supplier Co.",
    "brand_color": "f0C14B",
    "logo": "https://imagedelivery.net/image_url.png",
    "website": "supplier.com"
  },
  "receipt": { ... }
}
```

When you migrate to Webhooks, you'll subscribe to the `receipt.decrypted` event, which will send event metadata and a `data` payload, in the following format:

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_6abf1062dc2f4844a81b645b9a5dbf41",
  "event": "receipt.decrypted",
  "data": {
    "receipt": { ... },
    "checkout": {
      "key": "PlkzzmAhUwkdDme//TEKok7M934kX9REHdNyxNvj6Tk=",
      "sender": {
        "logo": null,
        "name": "[TEST] Sender",
        "org_id": "org_c1cd03fa4eab477cad07458b29774802",
        "website": "test-sender.versa.org",
        "brand_color": "#802365"
      },
      "handles": {
        "customer_email": "john.smith@example.com", 
        "customer_email_domain": "example.com"
      },
      "receipt_id": "rct_14a9817fea7d41bf941c16b8750cc845",
      "registered_at": 1739315357,
      "schema_version": "1.9.0",
      "transaction_id": "txn_6b408ba7406b4754b7b7d287e0ca9fdf",
      "transaction_event_index": 0
    }
  }
}
```

### Overview of Changes

1. Data is sent to your webhook `endpoint_url` instead of the `receiver_address` on your client credentials.
2. HMAC verification is performed using your webhook `secret` instead of the `receiver_secret` on your client credentials.
3. Data is wrapped in a WebhookEvent object, and the data contains both the decrypted `receipt` (matching the Versa schema) and the unaltered `checkout` object retrieved from the registry.

### Steps to Migrate

At the time of this writing, migration is only supported via API:

#### 1. Create a Webhook

Create a new webhook subscribed to the `receipt.decrypted` event.

```bash
curl -X POST https://registry.versa.org/webhook \
-H 'Authorization: Basic versa_cid_xxxxxxxxx:versa_csk_xxxxxxxxx' \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "endpoint_url": "https://my-service.com/versa-webhook-endpoint",
    "events": ["receipt.decrypted"]
   }'
```

The response will contain the new webhook record:

```json
{
  "id": "whk_f162da3d06a74a7d92d4b65d5e0957be",
  "org_id": "org_4b07578e38e6414383ed0cbbb72e5315",
  "client_id": "versa_cid_xxxxxxxxx",
  "secret": "versa_whsec_test_72762a2cad9ea7859aaba59e8c4ed3bb",
  "endpoint_url": "https://my-service.com/versa-webhook-endpoint",
  "version": "v2",
  "event_types": [
    "receipt.decrypted"
  ],
  "created": 1739314457,
  "last_used": 0,
  "disabled": null
}
```

#### 2. Handle the WebhookEvent

Deserialize the new structure in your webhook endpoint, and verify the event using the `secret` returned in the previous step.

#### 3. Test your Endpoint

Ensure that you are receiving data at the new endpoint, using our existing tools.

#### 4. (Optional) Unsubscribe from the 'legacy' webhook

Let us know when your migration is complete and we'll disable the v1 delivery system for your custodial client.

## API Reference

You can create, list, update, and delete your webhooks. As with rotating your v1 receiver_secret, you can also rotate your webhook secret at any time.

All webhook endpoints require Basic Authentication with your client credentials.

* POST `/webhook` - Create a new webhook
* GET `/webhook` - List all webhooks for your client
* PUT `/webhook/:id` - Update the `endpoint_url` or `events` for a specific webhook
* PUT `/webhook/:id/rotate` - Rotate the `secret` for a specific webhook
* DELETE `/webhook/:id` - Delete a specific webhook
