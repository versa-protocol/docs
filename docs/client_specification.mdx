# Client Specifications

A starting guide to implementing a Versa client. This guide is intended for developers who are integrating with the Versa network.

## Sender Specification

Senders on the Versa network are data providers; they participate in the network to provide a better billing experience for their customers.

To operate according to specification, senders must have:

- a production-gated client registered at https://app.versa.org
- the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET for the registered client
- the REGISTRY_URL of the Versa network (https://registry.versa.org)

### Step One: Construct a Versa Receipt from your data

You can experiment with our schema in our interactive studio here: https://versa.org/demo/interactive

Choose the itemization structure that makes the most sense for any given purchase. Convert your model to the a JSON structure that satisfies our [JSON schema](https://github.com/versa-protocol/schema);
then canonize the JSON with a library like [json-canon](https://crates.io/crates/json-canon) and generate a hash. We recommend using [SipHash 2](https://hexdocs.pm/siphash/2.0.0/SipHash.html), but hash verification of data
is not currently a protocol requirement.

### Step Two: Register a Receipt with Customer References

```sh
curl -X POST ${REGISTRY_URL}/http/register \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "handles": {
      "customer_email_domain": "acme.com"
    },
    "receipt_hash": "1234555",
    "schema_version": "1.0.0",
    }'
```

### Step Three: Encrypt and Send Receipts to Receivers

For each authorized receiver returned by the registry, generate a unique nonce, encrypt the receipt with the registry key and nonce,
then send the encrypted payload with nonce, hash, and receiptId to the receiver, including an HMAC Verification token in the X-Request-Signature header
(you will generate this with the receiver secret returned by the registry)

The encryption algorithm used by Versa is AES-SIV, which is a nonce-misuse resistant authenticated encryption algorithm. You can find implementations in various languages. See [Encryption](encryption) for more information.

## Receiver Specification

Receivers on the Versa network are data consumers; they participate in the network to provide a better expense, audit, or analytics experience for their customers.

To operate according to specification, receivers must have:

- a production-gated client registered at https://app.versa.org
- the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET for the registered client
- the REGISTRY_URL of the Versa network (https://registry.versa.org)
- a RECEIVER_SECRET with which to perform the HMAC verification of incoming receipts

### Step One: Receive an encrypted envelope

Verify the HMAC verification token in the X-Request-Signature header using your receiver secret, then make a checkout request to the registry.

### Step Two: Decrypt the envelope

The registry will return the sender information (including brand details like logo and color) and the encryption key. Use this key to decrypt the receipt data.

### Step Three: Process the Receipt

From here, it's up to you how to process the receipt. You can store it, run validation, and display it to the user either rolling your own UI or using our React library.

If the receipt is invalid, see Step Four:

### Step Four: Feedback and Reporting

Since the Versa registry does not handle receipts directly, we rely on receivers to provide feedback on the quality of the receipts they receive. If you receive a receipt that is invalid or produces warnings, you can report it to the registry.

Reasons a receipt might be invalid include:

1. Decryption fails using the provided key and nonce
2. The receipt data does not validate against our JSON schema for the attached schema version

Reasons a receipt might produce warnings include:

1. Actions or image URLs are not trusted sources (Coming soon: see [Assets](#) and [Trusted Sources](#))
2. The receipt data does not validate against our recommended validation checks
