# Receiving a Receipt

The receiver is a protocol client typically operated by a bank or spend management app. The receiver's responsiblities include:

1. Receive the encrypted receipt.
2. Exchange the hash for a key, via the registry.
3. Decrypt and render the receipt.

## Receive the encrypted receipt

An example payload that you will receive at your registered address, from the sender (merchant).

```json
{
  "receipt_hash": 175932758392347,
  "nonce": [...],
  "encrypted": [...]
}
```

## Exchange the hash for a key via the registry

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://registry.versa.org/checkout' \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic <CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "receipt_hash": 175932758392347,
    "schema_version": "1.0.0"
  }'
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "key": [...],
  "sender": {
    "name": "Platform Co.",
    "brand_color": "f0C14B",
    "logo": "https://static.platform.co/image_url.png",
    "website": "platform.co"
  }
}
```

The `sender` is a [merchant object](https://docs.versa.org/receipt#merchant).

## Decrypt and render the receipt

Receipts are decrypted with the AES 256 encryption algorithm, using the registry-provided key and a unique nonce provided by the sender.

Once decrypted, the receiver can either store and render the receipt as they see fit, or they can use the Versa frontend library to render the object.
