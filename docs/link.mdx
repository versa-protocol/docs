# Versa Link Integration Guide

Versa Link is the client-side component that your users will interact with in order to link their accounts to your app. It handles all aspects of the account linking experience.

You are welcome to implement your own [customer registration](/customer_registration) via the Versa API. Versa Link is an alternative method of customer registration, where most of the work is handled via the embeddable widget.

## Quick Start

Currently, Versa Link is in private beta. To get access, please contact us at [support@versa.org](mailto:support@versa.org).
