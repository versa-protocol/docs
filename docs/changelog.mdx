# Changelog

## 2025-10-30 - Schema Version 2.1.0

- Added `service` itemization to both the `receipt` and `itinerary` schemas
- Added nullable `carrier` string to `shipment` object
- Added nullable `logo_asset_id` string to `org` object
- Changed `brand_color` to be case-insensitive for the purpose of schema validation

### Update Events

- Added new schemas for our `transit_route` update events. See the [Events](https://docs.versa.org/events) documentation for more details

### Deprecation Notices

- The `subscription` itemization has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The `service` itemization should be used instead.
- The `logo` field has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The `logo_asset_id` field should be used instead.

## 2025-10-20 - Protocol Update

Beta release of [Update Events](/events#update-events).

- Specifying the `event_type` in the event registration payload filters receivers by subscription.
- Registration payloads of update events can exclude transaction `handles`; the handles will be looked up from the original event registration by `transaction_id`.

## 2025-07-18 - Protocol Update

Added the [Receiver Query API](/receiver_query_api) to replace 'check registry' (now deprecated).

## 2025-06-17 - Schema Version 2.0.0

This is a major version change. The grace period to get all senders and receivers migrated is currently indefinite; both `1.11.0` and `2.0.0` will be supported for the foreseeable future. We will automatically 'downshift' `2.0.0` receipts to `1.11.0` receipts for 'Custodial Receivers' (as needed) to smooth the transition. We will work with all clients directly on this migration, and we will deprecate `1.11.0` when we confirm 100% readiness.

If you’re a sender, please make a plan to migrate from `1.11.0` to `2.0.0`. If you’re a Custodial Receiver client, you’ll need to manually update your webhook’s maximum schema version, via the Versa dev portal, to start receiving `2.0.0` data (until you do, you will continue to receive `1.11.0` formatted data).

### Why?

The `2.0.0` update incorporates several points of customer feedback. It enables richer 'passenger' profiles for air travel / 'guest' profiles for hotel bookings. And it enables more flexibility around matching and corporate loyalty programs, to increase match rates.

### Breaking Changes

- `passenger` changes from a string to a new nullable `person` object (see the [Person documentation](/receipt#person) for details)
- `metadata` is removed from flight tickets (and included in the `person` object)
- `guests` is now an array of `person` objects
- `current_period_start` and `current_period_end` have been renamed `current_period_start_at` and `current_period_end_at` for consistency
- `metadata`, `taxes`, `adjustments` and other arrays that are valid when empty are now also optional and nullable

### Other Changes

- Fixed: `place` nullable fields are no longer required
- Fixed: `vehicle` nullable `image` is no longer required
- Fixed: `currency` now supports `cny` instead of `cnh`
- Added to rental car `vehicle`
  - `license_plate_number` (string)
  - `vehicle_class` (ACRISS car code, four letters)
- Added `adjustment_type` enum option: `add_on` (for e.g. paid seat upgrades)
- Added `website` to `customer`
- regex pattern validation for `vehicle_class`, `phone`, `routing_number`, `last_four` and airport codes
- minimum and maximum bounds for unix timestamps

### End of Life

Schema Version `1.10.0` and earlier are now considered at end of life (EOL) and are no longer supported. The registry will not accept new registrations for these versions.
