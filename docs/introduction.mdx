# Introduction

Versa is a protocol for the secure exchange of business receipt data between merchants (senders) and financial institutions (receivers).

## How It Works

The Versa Protocol is designed for the transfer of receipt data without the need to trust a third-party. Senders (merchants) send receipt data directly to customers’ financial services (their bank, their expense management software, etc.).

The receipt data never touches Versa servers. Instead, the Versa Registry acts like DNS on the web: the registry returns a list of authorized receivers for any given receipt, based on details about the customer (either the domain of the customer’s email, or a card reference). The rest of the exchange is handled directly between senders and registered receivers.
