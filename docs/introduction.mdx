# Introduction

Versa helps merchants securely send business receipt data to customers.

Gathering receipts historically has been a time-consuming administrative effort (snapping photos of paper receipts, taking screenshots of email receipts, etc.). With Versa, merchants send digital receipts directly to customers’ authorized financial apps (their bank or spend management software), resulting in less manual work, and better data.

## How It Works

The Versa Registry acts like DNS on the web: for any given sales receipt, the registry returns a list of matching authorized receivers. This list of authorized receivers is determined on the basis of a few key customer details (the domain of the customer’s email, a bank routing number, or card reference).

The Versa Protocal is designed such that merchants send receipts without needing to pass that data through middlemen. The receipts never touch Versa servers; the exchange is peer-to-peer.

On both ends, Versa offers open source client lbraries, assisting merchants with sending, and receivers with decrypting and rendering.
