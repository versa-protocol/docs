# Introduction

Versa is a protocol for the secure exchange of business receipt data between merchants (senders) and financial institutions (receivers).

## How It Works

The Versa Protocol is designed for data transfer without the need to trust a third-party. Senders (merchants) send receipts directly to a customers’ authorized financial apps (their bank or spend management software).

The receipt data never touches Versa servers. Instead, the Versa Registry acts like DNS on the web: the registry returns a list of authorized receivers for any given sale, based on details about the customer (the domain of the customer’s email, their bank routing number, or a card reference). The rest of the exchange is handled directly between senders and those registered receivers.
