# Introduction

Versa helps merchants securely send business receipt data to customers.

Gathering receipts historically has been a time-consuming administrative effort (snapping photos of paper receipts, taking screenshots of email receipts, etc.). With Versa, this process is automated: merchants send digital receipts directly to customers’ authorized financial apps (their bank or spend management software).

## How It Works

The Versa Registry acts something like DNS on the web. For any given sales receipt, the registry returns a list of matching authorized receivers. This list of authorized receivers is determined on the basis of a few key customer details (the domain of the customer’s email, a bank routing number, or card reference).

The Versa Protocal is designed such that merchants send receipts without needing to pass that data through trusted middlemen. The receipts never touch Versa servers; the exchange is peer-to-peer.

On both ends, Versa offers open source client lbraries, assisting merchants with the sending steps, and receivers with the decrypting and rendering steps. Use ours, or roll your own.
