# Introduction

Versa is a protocol for the secure exchange of receipt data between merchants and card issuers.

## How It Works

The Versa Protocol is designed such that receipt data never touches Versa servers. Versa acts somethinglike DNS on the web: Versa helps senders figure out where they need to send receipts, but the rest of the exchange is handled directly between senders and authorized receivers, without Versa's involvement.
