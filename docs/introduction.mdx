# Introduction

Versa is a protocol for the secure exchange of business receipt data between merchants (senders) and financial institutions (receivers).

## How It Works

The Versa Protocol is designed for the secure transfer of receipt data. Receipt data never touches our servers. Versa acts like DNS on the web: we help senders figure out where they need to send receipts, and the rest of the exchange is handled directly between senders and authorized receivers.
