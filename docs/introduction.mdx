# Introduction

Versa is a protocol for the secure exchange of business receipt data between merchants (senders) and financial institutions (receivers).

## How It Works

The Versa Protocol is designed for the secure transfer of receipt data. Senders (merchants) send receipt data directly to buyersâ€™ financial tools (their bank, their expense management software, etc.).

The receipt data never touches Versa servers. Instead, the Versa Registry acts like DNS on the web: the registry tells senders which receivers are authorized to receive their receipts, and the rest of the exchange is handled directly between those senders and registered receivers.
