# Introduction

Versa helps merchants securely send business receipt data to customers.

Gathering receipts can be a hassle (each employee snapping photos of paper receipts, taking screenshots of email receipts, etc.). With Versa, this process is automated: merchants send digital receipts directly to customers’ authorized financial apps (their bank or spend management software).

## How It Works ✨

With the Versa Protocol, merchants send receipts without needing to pass that data through trusted intermediaries. The receipts never touch Versa servers; the exchange is peer-to-peer.

For any given sales receipt, the Versa Registry returns a list of matching authorized receivers. This list of authorized receivers is determined on the basis of a few key transaction details (the domain of the customer’s email, a bank routing number, or card identifier).

Senders then encode the structured receipt data, and pass along the encrypted object to the authorized recipients.

On both ends, Versa offers an open source client library, stubbing out the sending, receiving, and rendering steps. Use our client library, or roll your own.

## Getting Started

If you are a receipt sender (merchant), start with the [Sending](/sending) guide; if you are a receipt receiver (expense management apps, financial institutions), start with the [Receiving](/receiving) guide. Contact us at support@versa.org with questions.
