# Introduction

Versa helps merchants securely send business receipt data to customers.

## How It Works

With Versa, merchants send receipts directly to customers’ authorized financial apps (their bank or spend management software). The receipt data never touches Versa servers; the system is designed such that there’s no need to pass purchase data through a third-party.

The Versa Registry acts like DNS on the web: for any given sales receipt, the registry returns a list of matching authorized receivers. This list of authorized receivers is determined on the basis of a few key customer details (the domain of the customer’s email, a bank routing number, or card reference). The rest of the exchange is handled between senders and receivers directly.
