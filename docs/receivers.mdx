# Receivers

All Versa receivers are registered Versa clients and have been verified during our onboarding process.
Since [sender registration](/customer_registration#receiver-vs-sender-customer-registration) requires explicitly identifying the receiver to which you are sending data,
receivers are queryable via our API.

## Receiver Query API

The Receiver Query API allows clients to discover and query receiver organizations in the Versa Registry.
This API enables senders to look up available data handling services in the network and understand their business category.
It also provides all the information necessary to programmatically populate a user interface for the purpose of sender registration.

### Overview

The Receiver Query API provides:
- Discovery of network receiver organizations, verified by the Versa team
- (Optional) Filtering by receiver category (expense, duty of care, etc.)
- (Optional) Routing status for a provided set of transaction handles

### Request Format

```
POST /receiver/query
```

The API accepts an optional JSON request body with the following structure:

```json
{
  "filters": [
    {
      "category": ["expense", "duty_of_care"]
    }
  ],
  "handles": {
    "customer_email_domain": "company.com",
    "merchant_group_code": "A932LH0"
  }
}
```

### Request Parameters

#### `filters` (optional)
Array of filter objects to limit results:

- **`category`**: Array of receiver categories to include
  - `"expense"` - Expense management receivers (Ramp, Emburse, etc.)
  - `"duty_of_care"` - Travel safety receivers (International SOS, etc.)

#### `handles` (optional)
Transaction handle information for routing queries:

- **`customer_email`**: Specific customer email address
- **`customer_email_domain`**: Customer's email domain
- **`merchant_group_code`**: A merchant identifier for the group or corporate entity, specific to the sending client
