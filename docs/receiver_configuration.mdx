# Receiver Configuration

Receipt receivers are typically expense management platforms or financial institutions. To receive receipts via the Versa network, you’ll first need to ]create an account](https://app.versa.org) on Versa.

Once you’re logged in to your account, you’re able to register the web address at which you will receive receipts. Go to the 'Credentials' tab, issue a new receiver key, and set your address.

## Register company handles

Now that your account is configured, you’ll need to register the customers for whom you’re authorized to receive receipts. To register a customer, you will need to post their work email domain.

Typically, you’ll do a batch registration when onboarding onto Versa, and from that point onwards, you’ll manage your list of authorized customers, registering and de-registering profiles.

To add a new registered profile:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://registry.versa.org/handle' \
  --header 'Authorization: <CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "handle_type": "email_domain",
    "handle": "acme.com"
  }'
```

| Field         | Type     | Description            |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| `handle_type` | `enum`   | One of `email_domain`. |
| `handle`      | `string` | The handle value.      |

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the only valid `handle_type` is `email_domain` however in the future we expect to add other types.

To remove a registered profile:

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://registry.versa.org/handle' \
  --header 'Authorization: <CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "handle_type": "email_domain",
    "handle": "acme.com"
  }'
```

You’re all set! Now prepare to [receive your first receipt](https://docs.versa.org/receiving).
