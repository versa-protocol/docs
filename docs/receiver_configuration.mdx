# Receiver Configuration

To get set up to receive receipts, the first step is to create your account on Versa.

Once you have an account and you’re logged in, you’ll need to register the web address at which you will receive receipts. Go to the 'Credentials' tab, issue a new receiver key, and set your address.

## Register company handles

Now all you need to do is register the customers for whom you’re authorized to receive receipts. Register the companies that you're authorized to receive receipts for.

To add new registered customers:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://registry.versa.org/handle' \
  --header 'Authorization: <CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "handle_type": "email_domain",
    "handle": "acme.com"
  }'
```

If you lose a customer, or they revoke your authority to receive their receipts, you will need to remove them from the registry:

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://registry.versa.org/handle' \
  --header 'Authorization: <CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "handle_type": "email_domain",
    "handle": "acme.com"
  }'
```

You’re all set! Now prepare to [receive your first receipt](https://docs.versa.org/receiving).
