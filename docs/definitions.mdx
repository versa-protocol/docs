## Currencies

All API requests expect amounts to be provided in a currency's smallest unit. For example, to charge 10 USD, provide an amount value of 1000 (that is, 1000 cents).

For zero-decimal currencies, still provide amounts as an integer but without multiplying by 100. For example, to charge Â¥500, provide an amount value of 500.
